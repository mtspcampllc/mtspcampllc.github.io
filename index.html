    <p>"Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore, whoever takes the lowly position of this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me." -Matthew 18:1-5</p>
    <p>"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life." -John 3:16</p>
    <p>"The King will reply, 'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.'" -Matthew 25:40</p>
    <p>"But Jesus said, 'Let the little children come to Me, and do not hinder them! For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these.'" -Matthew 19:14</p>
    <p>Together we make things happen!</p>
    <p>MTSP placed significant emphasis on the three paths of happiness: We sing to uplift their heart, We pray to empower their Spirit, We use words of wisdom to change their behavior.</p>
    <p>MTSP strongly belives that exercising the inward parts of kids is the gateway to a positive lifestyle, and that kids with great physique develop stronger self-esteem and greater self-confidence.</p>

    <p>Dennis and Barbara Blake are the founders of the faith-based not-for-profit organization Mentoring Thru Sports Professionals (MTSP). It was founded in 2012 and all started with a passionate phone call to the principal of Morningside Primary School in St. Elizabeth, Jamaica. Dennis was a former student of Morningside Primary School and took the opportunity to go back with his wife to visit the school after that phone call. During the visit, they witnessed first-hand, how the teachers and staff operate the school with such enthusiasm and passion, despite their limited resources. It was during that visit that Barbara and Dennis realized they wanted to do so much more for the school. When Dennis asked how they could help, the principal stated the school needed a summer camp program. She explained that kids were idle during the summer since the school was closed, and most ended up in trouble because of it. And so, the planning and coordinating began. Barbara and Dennis spent the next few months praying and planning to bring the summer camp to fruition. It was during this period they realized that a sports-based summer camp would be a good way to motivate and uplift the students, especially those who were less fortunate. The first camp was held in August of 2012. That summer, the camp hosted close to 200 students; 100 of which were pre-registered. The camp was held for one week. At the end of that week, the amount of positive feedback received from the students were so overwhelming that Dennis and Barbara decided to hold the camp each year. Ever since that first camp in 2012, they have been striving to make each camp better.

        <h3>A Place Where Kids Are Valued</h3>
        <p>MTSP is a nonprofit organization that was created to provide mentoring, teaching, sharing, and playing by using the fundamentals of sports to motivate the less fortunate. The organization uses sports as the backdrop to encourage kids to get involved and participate in daily activities. By using sports personalities and other professionals to share their personal experiences, kids are better able to understand and believe that they can be great citizens and use the values of sports to pull themselves out of poverty and adversity.
