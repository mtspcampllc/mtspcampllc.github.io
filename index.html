    <h2>
        A Place Where Kids Are Valued
    </h2>
    <p>Mentoring Thru Sports Professionals (MTSP) is a faith-based organization founded by Dennis &amp; Barbara Blake that uses sports to help disenfranchised schools in challenged communities. It's mission is to encourage, motivate, inspire, and provide hope to the youths in disenfranchised communities through sports engagement. The organization uses sports as the backdrop to encourage kids to get involved and participate in daily activities. By using sports personalities and other professionals to share their personal experiences, kids are better able to understand and believe that they can be great citizens and use the values of sports to pull themselves out of poverty and adversity.

        About Us
    </h2>
    <p>
        Dennis and Barbara Blake are the founders of the faith-based not-for-profit organization Mentoring Thru Sports Professionals (MTSP). It was founded in 2012 and all started with a passionate phone call to the principal of Morningside Primary School in St. Elizabeth, Jamaica. Barbara and Dennis spent the next few months praying and planning to bring the summer camp to fruition. It was during this period they realized that a sports-based summer camp would be a good way to motivate and uplift the students, especially those who were less fortunate.

    <p>
        <em>"This summer camp is a great experience for both adults and kids. It helps the kids to work together and acknowledge one another. The adults get the experience of their life working with the kids, for example, adults get chances to help kids learn more activities and get more educated in the sports they do. Overall the experience is spectacular." <br>-Andre</em>

        "I love the camp, and I like the people. They help us play games. I like the things that they carry for us to play with, and I love the skipping game. They give away prizes which was exciting." <br>-Prom Mickela
